# --- artifact discovery -------------------------------------------------
# Where a checkout's .cja is. Prefers `cajeta artifact-path`, which reads
# that project's OWN manifest -- so a project that moves its artifacts with
# settings.output is followed rather than guessed, and the version comes
# from details.version instead of whichever file happens to be newest.
#
# Falls back to the historical build/archive glob only when the toolchain
# does not HAVE the verb (it lands after 0.24.0), so this keeps working on
# an older cajeta and starts using the verb as soon as a newer one is on
# PATH -- no flag day.
#
# The gate is the CAPABILITY, not the outcome. A fallback keyed on "the
# verb failed" would silently mask a verb that ran and answered wrongly,
# which is the very failure this replaces; keyed on "the verb is absent",
# it cannot. An empty result still means "not in this checkout", exactly
# as the glob did, so callers' registry fallbacks are unchanged.
